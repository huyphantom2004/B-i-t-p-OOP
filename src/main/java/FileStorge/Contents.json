        "Nội dung chi tiết bài viết": "Everyone is concerned about cybersecurity today, and they should be as cyber-attacks are on the rise. However, it seems that whenever a new IT advance comes along, people ask, \u201CHow secure is it?\u201D\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology originally created to support Bitcoin. However, the technology\u2019s popularity has soared, and people are discovering that blockchain has uses that go beyond cryptocurrency. This newfound popularity, naturally, begs the question of blockchain\u2019s safety and integrity.\nThat\u2019s why today we\u2019re investigating blockchain security, what it is and how it works. We\u2019ll also touch upon some current examples of blockchain security in action.\nAfter all, if big companies like IBM, Walmart, and FedEx use blockchain technology, it would be reassuring to know that the security aspect is up to the task.\n\nWhat is Blockchain Security?\nWe begin by reminding ourselves about blockchain itself and what it is. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) designed to engender trust and confidence in an environment. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger system that\u2019s duplicated and distributed across a whole network of computer systems. It allows information access to all designated nodes or members who can record, share, and view encrypted transactional data on their blockchain.\nBlockchain technology gathers and stores information in groups, also referred to as \u201Cblocks,\u201D and each block can hold a certain amount of data. When the block reaches capacity, it is chained to the previous full block, creating a chain of data, hence the clever name \u201Cblockchain.\u201D\nBlockchain security is a complete risk management system for blockchain networks, incorporating assurance services, cybersecurity frameworks, and best practices to mitigate the risks of fraud and cyber-attacks.\nBlockchain technology's data structures have inherent security qualities because they are based on consensus, cryptography, and decentralization principles. Each new block of information connects to all the previous blocks in a way that it's nearly impossible to tamper with. In addition, all transactions in a block get validated and agreed on by a consensus mechanism (authorized users), guaranteeing that each transaction is true and accurate. Thus, there is no point of failure, and a user can\u2019t change transaction records.\nHowever, blockchain security goes even beyond its inherent security characteristics. Here\u2019s how.\nWhat Are the Types of Blockchain?\nBefore we explain how blockchain provides security, we need to point out several types of blockchains, each with unique challenges.\nPrivate blockchain networks require an invitation. Users must be validated by either the network\u2019s central administrator or starter or by a rule set put in place by the network\u2019s administrator. Businesses that use private blockchains typically set up a permissioned network. Permissioned networks limit who can participate in the network and the types of transactions they can initiate. In any case, participants need either an invitation or permission to join.\nPrivate blockchains typically use a \u201CProof-of-Authority\u201D (PoA) consensus approach and are often used in internal, business secure environments to handle tasks such as access, authentication, and record keeping. The transaction data is typically kept private.\nPublic blockchains focus on participation and transparency. Transaction consensus is \u201Cdecentralized,\u201D meaning anyone can participate in validating network transactions, and the software code is open-source and available to the public (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum).\nThe main characteristic of public blockchain networks is decentralization through cryptoeconomics, made to ensure cooperation throughout a distributed network. In public blockchains, it means the network has no political center of control, and the software system design has no architectural central point-of-failure.\nHow much of a blockchain is decentralized relies on the design of the consensus algorithm, network governance, ownership of cryptographic \u201Cprivate keys,\u201D and providing economic incentives. Consider, for instance, the concept of \u201Cdata mining,\u201D where users earn cryptocurrency by validating transactions. This reward gives people the motivation to join the network and participate in validating the transactions.\nGovernance considerations cover who develops the software code, who can work in the consensus mechanism, and who can participate in the communal governance activities that maintain the network. Public blockchain consensus mechanisms are primarily \u201CProof-of-Work\u201D (PoW) or \u201CProof-of-Stake\u201D (PoS).\nHowever, as far as access goes, anyone can join and validate transactions, and that's the significant difference between public and private blockchains.\nTypically, when discussing blockchains, public and private blockchains are the only ones mentioned. However, there is a third option: consortium blockchains. Consortium blockchains consist of known participants preapproved by a central authority to participate in the consensus within a blockchain network. This \u201Csemi-permissioned\u201D approach allows a network to be distributed or partly decentralized, yet still allowing for a degree of control over it. Incidentally, transaction data in consortium blockchains can be kept private.\nConsortium blockchains can reach consensus via \u201CProof-of-Work\u201D (PoW), \u201CProof of Authority (PoA), or \u201CProof-of-Stake\u201D (PoS). In addition, there are other available methods, such as delegated proof-of-stake.\nConsortium blockchains are best suited for use between known parties, banking, supply chain management, or Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\nBlockchain Security Challenges\nBlockchain isn\u2019t perfect. There are ways that cyber criminals can manipulate blockchain\u2019s vulnerabilities and cause severe damage. Here are four ways that hackers can attack blockchain technology.\nBecome a Software Development Professional\nThe certification helped me with my career. After finishing the course, I was assigned new projects within my organization. My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the new age of tech for the upliftment of the needy. The course will really help me do it.\nMy learning experience was outstanding. Since I am a working professional, I liked the blended learning environment where I could learn at my own pace. The instructor-led live classes were also unique. I learned a lot of things during the course. After the course completion, I could grab a new job.\n6 Blockchain Security Examples\nHere\u2019s a handful of examples of how companies and organizations are conducting blockchain security.\nThis California-based cryptocurrency company is developing a secure, user-friendly cryptocurrency for businesses that cannot afford to implement ledger security measures independently. Mobilecoin\u2019s cryptocurrency replaces third-party transaction vendors, keeping all the transaction data encrypted at both ends. The product works with Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Signal.\nHere\u2019s another California-based cryptocurrency company. Coinbase is an exchange for selling and purchasing digital currency. Running entirely on encryption, Coinbase stores wallets and passwords in a secure database. Employees must undergo a rigorous background check to ensure cryptocurrency safety.\nJ.P. Morgan is the largest and one of the most popular financial institutions in the United States. It has developed an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum called Quorum, using blockchain technology to process private transactions. J.P. Morgan uses smart contracts on their Quorum network to create transparent yet cryptographically assured transactions.\nThis US-based defense contractor is the first company of its kind to implement blockchain security. Lockheed Martin is working with the cybersecurity firm Guardtime Federal to institute blockchain cybersecurity protocols in engineering systems, software development, and supply chain risk management. Lockheed Martin\u2019s goal is to use blockchain to protect every step of its weapon development systems.\nThis California-based tech giant believes that blockchain is ideally suited for the Internet of Things (IoT) because the inherent ledger technology does away with single points of failure and secures vital private data with encryption. This idea is significant since the Internet of Things has been growing steadily. If blockchain technology becomes the preferred IoT network, this will boost blockchain\u2019s visibility and use. Of course, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a big IoT player in your corner!\nThis Tennessee-based healthcare innovation firm wants to help the healthcare industry to implement blockchain technology. The firm consists of Hashed Collective, Hashed Enterprise, and Hashed Labs, and each entity focuses on different aspects of blockchain. Hashed Health has partnered with many hospitals and healthcare companies to build secure digital blockchain networks dedicated to patient information sharing and confidential internal communication channels.\nDo You Want More In-Depth Knowledge of Blockchain?\nIf you would like to pursue a blockchain-related career or just upskill your current skill set, you should check out Simplilearn\u2019s Professional Certificate Program in Blockchain.
