However, it seems that whenever a new IT advance comes along, people ask, \u201CHow secure is it?\u201D\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology originally created to support Bitcoin. However, the technology\u2019s popularity has soared, and people are discovering that blockchain has uses that go beyond cryptocurrency. This newfound popularity, naturally, begs the question of blockchain\u2019s safety and integrity.\nThat\u2019s why today we\u2019re investigating blockchain security, what it is and how it works. We\u2019ll also touch upon some current examples of blockchain security in action.\nAfter all, if big companies like IBM, Walmart, and FedEx use blockchain technology, it would be reassuring to know that the security aspect is up to the task.\n\nWhat is Blockchain Security?\nWe begin by reminding ourselves about blockchain itself and what it is. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) designed to engender trust and confidence in an environment. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger system that\u2019s duplicated and distributed across a whole network of computer systems. It allows information access to all designated nodes or members who can record, share, and view encrypted transactional data on their blockchain.\nBlockchain technology gathers and stores information in groups, also referred to as \u201Cblocks,\u201D and each block can hold a certain amount of data. When the block reaches capacity, it is chained to the previous full block, creating a chain of data, hence the clever name \u201Cblockchain.\u201D\nBlockchain security is a complete risk management system for blockchain networks, incorporating assurance services, cybersecurity frameworks, and best practices to mitigate the risks of fraud and cyber-attacks.\nBlockchain technology's data structures have inherent security qualities because they are based on consensus, cryptography, and decentralization principles. Each new block of information connects to all the previous blocks in a way that it's nearly impossible to tamper with. In addition, all transactions in a block get validated and agreed on by a consensus mechanism (authorized users), guaranteeing that each transaction is true and accurate. Thus, there is no point of failure, and a user can\u2019t change transaction records.\nHowever, blockchain security goes even beyond its inherent security characteristics. Here\u2019s how.\nWhat Are the Types of Blockchain?\nBefore we explain how blockchain provides security, we need to point out several types of blockchains, each with unique challenges.\nPrivate blockchain networks require an invitation. Users must be validated by either the network\u2019s central administrator or starter or by a rule set put in place by the network\u2019s administrator. Businesses that use private blockchains typically set up a permissioned network. Permissioned networks limit who can participate in the network and the types of transactions they can initiate. In any case, participants need either an invitation or permission to join.\nPrivate blockchains typically use a \u201CProof-of-Authority\u201D (PoA) consensus approach and are often used in internal, business secure environments to handle tasks such as access, authentication, and record keeping. The transaction data is typically kept private.\nPublic blockchains focus on participation and transparency. Transaction consensus is \u201Cdecentralized,\u201D meaning anyone can participate in validating network transactions, and the software code is open-source and available to the public (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum).\nThe main characteristic of public blockchain networks is decentralization through cryptoeconomics, made to ensure cooperation throughout a distributed network. In public blockchains, it means the network has no political center of control, and the software system design has no architectural central point-of-failure.\nHow much of a blockchain is decentralized relies on the design of the consensus algorithm, network governance, ownership of cryptographic \u201Cprivate keys,\u201D and providing economic incentives. Consider, for instance, the concept of \u201Cdata mining,\u201D where users earn cryptocurrency by validating transactions. This reward gives people the motivation to join the network and participate in validating the transactions.\nGovernance considerations cover who develops the software code, who can work in the consensus mechanism, and who can participate in the communal governance activities that maintain the network. Public blockchain consensus mechanisms are primarily \u201CProof-of-Work\u201D (PoW) or \u201CProof-of-Stake\u201D (PoS).\nHowever, as far as access goes, anyone can join and validate transactions, and that's the significant difference between public and private blockchains.\nTypically, when discussing blockchains, public and private blockchains are the only ones mentioned. However, there is a third option: consortium blockchains. Consortium blockchains consist of known participants preapproved by a central authority to participate in the consensus within a blockchain network. This \u201Csemi-permissioned\u201D approach allows a network to be distributed or partly decentralized, yet still allowing for a degree of control over it. Incidentally, transaction data in consortium blockchains can be kept private.\nConsortium blockchains can reach consensus via \u201CProof-of-Work\u201D (PoW), \u201CProof of Authority (PoA), or \u201CProof-of-Stake\u201D (PoS). In addition, there are other available methods, such as delegated proof-of-stake.\nConsortium blockchains are best suited for use between known parties, banking, supply chain management, or Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\nBlockchain Security Challenges\nBlockchain isn\u2019t perfect. There are ways that cyber criminals can manipulate blockchain\u2019s vulnerabilities and cause severe damage. Here are four ways that hackers can attack blockchain technology.\nBecome a Software Development Professional\nThe certification helped me with my career. After finishing the course, I was assigned new projects within my organization. My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the new age of tech for the upliftment of the needy. The course will really help me do it.\nMy learning experience was outstanding. Since I am a working professional, I liked the blended learning environment where I could learn at my own pace. The instructor-led live classes were also unique. I learned a lot of things during the course. After the course completion, I could grab a new job.\n6 Blockchain Security Examples\nHere\u2019s a handful of examples of how companies and organizations are conducting blockchain security.\nThis California-based cryptocurrency company is developing a secure, user-friendly cryptocurrency for businesses that cannot afford to implement ledger security measures independently. Mobilecoin\u2019s cryptocurrency replaces third-party transaction vendors, keeping all the transaction data encrypted at both ends. The product works with Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Signal.\nHere\u2019s another California-based cryptocurrency company. Coinbase is an exchange for selling and purchasing digital currency. Running entirely on encryption, Coinbase stores wallets and passwords in a secure database. Employees must undergo a rigorous background check to ensure cryptocurrency safety.\nJ.P. Morgan is the largest and one of the most popular financial institutions in the United States. It has developed an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum called Quorum, using blockchain technology to process private transactions. J.P. Morgan uses smart contracts on their Quorum network to create transparent yet cryptographically assured transactions.\nThis US-based defense contractor is the first company of its kind to implement blockchain security. Lockheed Martin is working with the cybersecurity firm Guardtime Federal to institute blockchain cybersecurity protocols in engineering systems, software development, and supply chain risk management. Lockheed Martin\u2019s goal is to use blockchain to protect every step of its weapon development systems.\nThis California-based tech giant believes that blockchain is ideally suited for the Internet of Things (IoT) because the inherent ledger technology does away with single points of failure and secures vital private data with encryption. This idea is significant since the Internet of Things has been growing steadily. If blockchain technology becomes the preferred IoT network, this will boost blockchain\u2019s visibility and use. Of course, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a big IoT player in your corner!\nThis Tennessee-based healthcare innovation firm wants to help the healthcare industry to implement blockchain technology. The firm consists of Hashed Collective, Hashed Enterprise, and Hashed Labs, and each entity focuses on different aspects of blockchain. Hashed Health has partnered with many hospitals and healthcare companies to build secure digital blockchain networks dedicated to patient information sharing and confidential internal communication channels.\nDo You Want More In-Depth Knowledge of Blockchain?\nIf you would like to pursue a blockchain-related career or just upskill your current skill set, you should check out Simplilearn\u2019s Professional Certificate Program in Blockchain.

It is most commonly associated with the digital currency bitcoin, but it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including smart contracts, supply chain management, and voting systems. The key feature of blockchain technology is that it is a distributed ledger, meaning that there is no central authority or intermediary controlling the system. Instead, transactions are recorded and verified by the network of users, making it a secure and tamper-proof way of storing and sharing data.\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence?\nAI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are made to think and act like humans. It involves creating algorithms and computer programs that can execute tasks that usually require human cognition, including visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Different forms of AI exist, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.\nInterlinking of the Blockchain Technology and AI\nBlockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two distinct but complementary fields. Both are considered cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. However, they can also be combined to create powerful new solutions.\nOne way that blockchain and AI can be combined is through the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. By using AI to create smart contracts, it is possible to automatically execute the contract when certain conditions are met, such as when a payment is received or when a delivery is made. This can greatly reduce the need for intermediaries and increase the efficiency of business transactions.\nIdeal Model\nWhile blockchain and AI are known to have functioning individually and independently, the two technologies are more intertwined than ever in recent times. One such area where the combination of AI and blockchain would serve as the ideal model is data handling. The combination helps deal with data-related issues by breaking down the data into smaller parts in a blockchain, which is then distributed across the network.\nThis model can solve some of the major issues for businesses from various industries. While AI can enhance the performance, accuracy, and efficiency of the data, blockchain can run computer networks by looking for power and energy.\nBlockchain vs. Artificial Intelligence\nWith major business implications at a phenomenal rate, both AI and blockchain have a promising future and are here to stay. However, when compared, both AI and blockchain have their own differences and complexities. One of the major issues with blockchain is security, while AI poses the issues of trustworthiness. Taking these issues and more, such as privacy, efficiency, and scalability into consideration, these two technologies can fill the gaps they both individually have.\nBecome a Software Development Professional\nHow Do AI and Blockchain Technology Complement Each Other?\nAI and blockchain technology complement each other by allowing for more efficient, secure, and transparent systems. AI algorithms can be used to process and analyze data, automate processes, and create smart contracts, while blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent way to store and manage data, execute automated processes, and record smart contracts.\nTogether, they can enable new use cases such as predictive maintenance, intelligent supply chain management, and decentralized autonomous organizations. Additionally, blockchain can provide a secure and transparent way to manage and protect sensitive data used for AI models, thereby increasing trust in AI-based decisions and predictions. Overall, the combination of AI and blockchain technology can lead to more efficient, secure, and transparent systems.\nUse Cases for Blockchain and AI\nThere are several potential use cases for combining blockchain and AI. Some of them are:\nAdvantages of Combining AI With Blockchain\nCombining AI with blockchain technology has the potential to offer several advantages, which include:\nChallenges to the Adoption of AI-Based Blockchain Solutions\nAdoption of AI-based blockchain solutions, while very advantageous, can pose several challenges as well.

According to The Motley Fool, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has some big-name founding members, including Microsoft, Intel, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\u201CThe adoption of Ethereum by the corporate world,\u201D says CNBC, \u201Cmeans it could eventually be bigger than its early stage rival.\u201D That means it\u2019s time to get to know the Ethereum platform, including its features and applications, and what makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin.\nOur \u201CEthereum Explained\u201D Ethereum tutorial video lays it all out for you, and here we\u2019ll cover what\u2019s discussed in the video.\n\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\nEthereum is a blockchain-based computing platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications\u2014meaning not run by a centralized authority. You can create a decentralized application for which the participants of that particular application are the decision-making authority.\nEthereum Features\nThese are Ethereum\u2019s essential features. Before going deep into the Ethereum tutorial, let\u2019s discuss each of these features in more detail.\nEther (ETH) is Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency. It is the fuel that runs the network. It is used to pay for the computational resources and the transaction fees for any transaction executed on the Ethereum network. Like Bitcoins, ether is a peer-to-peer currency. Apart from being used to pay for transactions, ether is also used to buy gas, which is used to pay for the computation of any transaction made on the Ethereum network.\nAlso, if you want to deploy a contract on Ethereum, you will need gas, and you would have to pay for that gas in ether. So gas is the execution fee paid by a user for running a transaction in Ethereum. Ether can be utilized for building decentralized applications, building smart contracts, and making regular peer-to-peer payments.\nSmart contracts are revolutionizing how traditional contracts work, which is why you need to use the tutorial to become more familiar with them. A smart contract is a simple computer program that facilitates the exchange of any asset between two parties. It could be money, shares, property, or any other digital asset that you want to exchange. Anyone on the Ethereum network can create these contracts. The contract consists primarily of the terms and conditions mutually agreed on between the parties (peers).\nThe smart contract\u2019s primary feature is that once it is executed, it cannot be altered, and any transaction done on top of a smart contract is registered permanently\u2014it is immutable. So even if you modify the smart contract in the future, the transactions correlated with the original contract will not get altered; you cannot edit them.\nThe verification process for the smart contracts is carried out by anonymous parties in the network without the need for a centralized authority, and that\u2019s what makes any smart contract execution on Ethereum a decentralized execution.\nThe transfer of any asset or currency is done in a transparent and trustworthy manner, and the identities of the two entities are secure on the Ethereum network. Once the transaction is successfully done, the accounts of the sender and receiver are updated accordingly, and in this way, it generates trust between the parties.\n\n\nIn conventional contract systems, you sign an agreement, then you trust and hire a third party for its execution. The problem is that in this type of process, data tampering is possible. With smart contracts, the agreement is coded in a program.\nA centralized authority does not verify the result; it is confirmed by the participants on the Ethereum blockchain-based network. Once a contract is executed, the transaction is registered and cannot be altered or tampered, so it removes the risk of any data manipulation or alteration.\nLet\u2019s take an example in which someone named Zack has given a contract of $500 to someone named Elsa for developing his company\u2019s website. The developers code the agreement of the smart contract using Ethereum\u2019s programming language.\nThe smart contract has all the conditions (requirements) for building the website. Once the code is written, it is uploaded and deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nEVM is a runtime compiler to execute a smart contract. Once the code is deployed on the EVM, every participant on the network has a copy of the contract. When Elsa submits the work on Ethereum for evaluation, each node on the Ethereum network will evaluate and confirm whether the result given by Elsa has been done as per the coding requirements.\nOnce the result is approved and verified, the contract worth $500 will be self-executed, and the payment will be paid to Elsa in ether. Zack\u2019s account will be automatically debited, and Elsa will be credited with $500 in ether.\nThe Ethereum tutorial video includes a demo on the deployment of an Ethereum smart contract.\n\nEVM, as mentioned above in this Ethereum tutorial, is designed to operate as a runtime environment for compiling and deploying Ethereum-based smart contracts. EVM is the engine that understands the language of smart contracts, which are written in the Solidity language for Ethereum. EVM is operated in a sandbox environment\u2014basically, you can deploy your stand-alone environment, which can act as a testing and development environment. You can then test your smart contract (use it) \u201Cn\u201D number of times, verify it, and once you are satisfied with the performance and the functionality of the smart contract, you can deploy it on the Ethereum main network.\nAny programming language in the smart contract is compiled into the bytecode, which the EVM understands. This bytecode can be read and executed using the EVM. Solidity is one of the most popular languages for writing a smart contract. Once you write your smart contract in Solidity, that contract gets converted into the bytecode and gets deployed on the EVM, thereby guaranteeing security from cyberattacks.\nSuppose person A wants to pay person B 10 ethers. The transaction will be sent to the EVM using a smart contract for a fund transfer from A to B. To validate the transaction; the Ethereum network will perform the proof-of-work consensus algorithm.\n\n\nThe miner nodes on Ethereum will validate this transaction\u2014whether the identity of A exists or not, and if A has the requested amount to transfer. Once the transaction is confirmed, the ether will be debited from A\u2019s wallet and will be credited to B\u2019s wallet, and during this process, the miners will charge a fee to validate this transaction and will earn a reward.\nAll the nodes on the Ethereum network execute smart contracts using their respective EVMs.\nEvery node in the Ethereum network has:\nThe goal of the miners on the Ethereum network is to validate the blocks. For each block of a transaction, miners use their computational power and resources to get the appropriate hash value by varying the nonce. The miners will vary the nonce and pass it through a hashing algorithm\u2014in Ethereum, it is the Ethash algorithm.\nThis produces a hash value that should be less than the predefined target as per the proof-of-work consensus. If the hash value generated is less than the target value, then the block is considered to be verified, and the miner gets rewarded.\nWhen the proof of work is solved, the result is broadcast and shared with all the other nodes to update their ledger. If other nodes accept the hashed block as valid, then the block gets added to the Ethereum main blockchain, and as a result, the miner receives a reward, which as of today stands at three ethers. Plus, the miner gets the transaction fees that have been generated for verifying the block. All the transactions that are aggregated in the block\u2014the cumulative transaction fees associated with all the transactions are also rewarded to the miner.\nIn Ethereum, a process called proof of stake is also under development. It is an alternative to proof of work and is meant to be a solution to minimize the use of expensive resources spent on mining using proof of work. In proof of stake, the miner\u2014who is the validator\u2014can validate the transactions based on the number of crypto coins he or she holds before actually starting the mining.\nSo, based on the accumulation of crypto coins the miner has beforehand, he or she has a higher probability of mining the block. However, proof of stake is not widely used as of now compared to proof of work.\nJust like we need fuel to run a car, we need gas to run applications on the Ethereum network. To perform any transaction within the Ethereum network, a user must make a payment, in this case paying out ethers, to get a transaction done, and the intermediary monetary value is called gas.\nOn the Ethereum network, gas is a unit that measures the computational power required to run a smart contract or a transaction. So, if you must do a transaction that updates the blockchain, you would have to shell out gas, and that gas costs ethers.\nIn Ethereum, the transaction fees are calculated using a formula (see screenshot below). For every transaction, there is gas and its correlated gas price. The transaction fees equal the amount of gas required to execute a transaction multiplied by the gas price. \u201CGas limit\u201D refers to the amount of gas used for the computation and the amount of ether a user is required to pay for the gas.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the Ethereum network showing the transaction cost. You can see for this particular transaction, the gas limit was 21,000, the gas used by the transaction was 21,000, and the gas price was 21 Gwei, which is the lowest denomination of ether. So, 21 Gwei * 21,000 gave the actual transaction fees: 0.000441 ethers, or about 21 cents as of today. As mentioned, the transaction fee goes to the miner, who has validated the transaction.\n\nTo understand the gas limit and price, let\u2019s consider an example using a car. Suppose your vehicle has a mileage of 10 kilometers per liter and petrol costs $1 per liter. Under these parameters, driving a car for 50 kilometers would cost you five liters of petrol, which is worth $5. Similarly, to perform an operation or to run code on Ethereum, you need to obtain a certain amount of gas, like petrol, and the gas has a per-unit price, called gas price.\n\n\nIf the user provides less than the amount of gas to run an operation, then the process will fail, and the user will be given the message \u201Cout of gas.\u201D And Gwei, as noted above, is the lowest denomination of ether used for measuring a unit of a gas price.\ne) How is Ethereum Mining Different from Bitcoin Mining?\nBitcoin\nEthereum\nHashing Algorithm\nSHA-256\nEthash\nTime is taken to mine a block\nAn average of 10 minutes\nAn average of 12-15 seconds\nReward\n12.5 BTC\n3 ETH\nUSD - 04\/10\/2019\n1 Bitcoin = 5249.03\n1 Ether = 180.89\nLet\u2019s compare decentralized applications with traditional applications. When you log in to Twitter, for example, a web application gets displayed that is rendered using HTML. The page will call an API to access your data (your information), which is centrally hosted. It\u2019s a simple process: your front end executes the backend API, and the API goes and fetches your data from a centralized database.\n\nIf we transform this application into a decentralized application when you log in, the same web application gets rendered, but it calls a smart contract-based API to fetch the information from the blockchain network. So, the API is replaced by a smart contract interface, and the smart contract will bring the data from the blockchain network, which is its back end.\nThat blockchain network is not a centralized database; it\u2019s a decentralized network in which the participants of the network (the miners) validate (verify) all the transactions that are happening using the smart contract on the blockchain network. So, any transaction or action happening on a Twitter-type application that has now been transformed will be a decentralized transaction.\nA Dapp consists of a backing code that runs on a distributed peer-to-peer network. It is a software designed to work in the Ethereum network without being controlled by a centralized system, as mentioned, and that is the primary difference: it provides direct interaction between the end-users and the decentralized application providers.\nAn application qualifies as a Dapp when it is open-source (its code is on Github), and it uses a public blockchain-based token to run its applications. A token acts as fuel for the decentralized application to run. Dapp allows the back end code and data to be decentralized, and that is the primary architecture of any Dapp.\nA DAO is a digital organization that operates without hierarchical management; it works in a decentralized and democratic fashion. So basically, a DAO is an organization in which the decision-making is not in the hands of a centralized authority but preferably in the hands of certain designated authorities or a group or designated people as a part of an authority. It exists on a blockchain network, where it is governed by the protocols embedded in a smart contract, and thereby, DAOs rely on smart contracts for decision-making\u2014or, we can say, decentralized voting systems\u2014within the organization. So, before any organizational decision can be made, it must go through the voting system, which runs on a decentralized application.\nHere\u2019s how it works. People add funds through the DAO because the DAO requires funding in order to execute and make decisions. Based on that, each member is given a token that represents that person\u2019s percentage of shares in the DAO. Those tokens are used to vote in the DAO, and the proposal status is decided based on the maximum votes. Every decision within the organization must go through this voting process.\n\n\nReal-World Applications of Ethereum\nConclusion\nHead over to our \u201CEthereum Explained\u201D Ethereum tutorial video to see an in-depth demo on how to deploy an Ethereum smart contract locally, including installing Ganache and Node in a Windows environment.\nAnd if you want to take your career to the next level, what are you waiting for?

They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable\u2014the term used to describe the inability to be altered.\nBecause there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.\nSince Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.\nInvestopedia \/ Xiaojie Liu\nHow Does a Blockchain Work?\nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\nThe blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a block, like a cell in a spreadsheet containing information. Once it is full, the information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the hash.\nThe hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in the block. This creates a series of blocks that are chained together.\nTransactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain they are taking place on. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet\u2014the application that provides an interface for the blockchain\u2014it starts a sequence of events.\nIn Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner or validator picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed and encrypted using an encryption algorithm. Then, the mining begins.\nThe entire network works simultaneously, trying to \"solve\" the hash. Each one generates a random hash except for the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.\nEvery miner starts with a nonce of zero, which is appended to their randomly-generated hash. If that number isn't equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, and a new block hash is generated. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.\nGenerating random hashes until a specific value is found is the \"proof-of-work\" you hear so much about\u2014it \"proves\" the miner did the work. The amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.\nOnce a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered to be confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals about 60 minutes).\nNot all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin's process.\nBlockchain Decentralization\nA blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes\u2014computers or devices running software for the blockchain\u2014at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would prevent it from happening. This way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it.\nBecause of this distribution\u2014and the encrypted proof that work was done\u2014the information and history (like the transactions in cryptocurrency) are irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company\u2019s inventory.\nBlockchain Transparency\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.\nFor example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous\u2014except for their wallet address\u2014the crypto they extracted are easily traceable because the wallet addresses are published on the blockchain.\nOf course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.\nIs Blockchain Secure?\nBlockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the \u201Cend\u201D of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be changed.\nA change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block's hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would reject an altered block because the hashes would not match.\nNot all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.\nFor instance, imagine that a hacker runs a node on a blockchain network and wants to alter a blockchain and steal cryptocurrency from everyone else. If they were to change their copy, they would have to convince the other nodes that their copy was the valid one.\nThey would need to control a majority of the network to do this and insert it at just the right moment. This is known as a 51% attack because you need to control more than 50% of the network to attempt it.\nTiming would be everything in this type of attack\u2014by the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally fast\u2014the Bitcoin network hashed at 348.1 exahashes per second (18 zeros) on April 21, 2023.\nBitcoin vs. Blockchain\nBlockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn\u2019t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.\nThe Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as \u201Ca new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\u201D\nThe key thing to understand is that Bitcoin uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments or other transactions between parties.\nBlockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. This could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.\nCurrently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society other than just recording transactions\u2014for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections.\nThe nature of blockchain\u2019s immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country's citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token.\nEach candidate would then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate for whom they wish to vote. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.\nBlockchain vs. Banks\nBlockchains have been heralded as a disruptive force in the finance sector, especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.\nTo see how a bank differs from blockchain, let\u2019s compare the banking system to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain implementation.\nHow Are Blockchains Used?\nAs we now know, blocks on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain store transactional data. Today, more than 23,000 other cryptocurrency systems are running on a blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions.\nSome companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever, among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.\nWhy do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria; in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.\nUsing blockchain allows brands to track a food product\u2019s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner\u2014potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist.\nPerhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account.\nEven if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.\nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds\u2014the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.\nThe settlement and clearing process for stock traders can take up to three days (or longer if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period. Blockchain could drastically reduce that time.\nBlockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Under this central authority system, a user\u2019s data and currency are technically at the whim of their bank or government. If a user\u2019s bank is hacked, the client\u2019s private information is at risk.\nIf the client\u2019s bank collapses or the client lives in a country with an unstable government, the value of their currency may be at risk. In 2008, several failing banks were bailed out\u2014partially using taxpayer money. These are the worries out of which Bitcoin was first conceived and developed.\nBlockchain can also give those in countries with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency and financial system. They would have access to more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions with whom they can do domestic and international business.\nBy spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for a central authority. This not only reduces risk but also the processing and transaction fees.\nUsing cryptocurrency wallets for savings accounts or as a means of payment is especially profound for those without state identification. Some countries may be war-torn or have governments lacking any real identification infrastructure. Citizens of such countries may not have access to savings or brokerage accounts\u2014and, therefore, no way to safely store wealth.\nHealthcare providers can leverage blockchain to store their patients\u2019 medical records securely. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with the proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key so that they are only accessible to specific individuals, thereby ensuring privacy.\nIf you have ever spent time in your local Recorder\u2019s Office, you will know that recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into the county\u2019s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index.\nThis process is not just costly and time-consuming, it is also prone to human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.\nIn war-torn countries or areas with little to no government or financial infrastructure and no Recorder\u2019s Office, proving property ownership can be nearly impossible. If a group of people living in such an area can leverage blockchain, then transparent and clear timelines of property ownership could be established.\nA smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out.\nSay, for example, that a potential tenant would like to lease an apartment using a smart contract. The landlord agrees to give the tenant the door code to the apartment as soon as the tenant pays the security deposit. The smart contract would automatically send the door code to the tenant when it was paid. It could also be programmed to change the code if rent wasn't paid or other conditions were met.\nAs in the IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as \u201COrganic,\u201D \u201CLocal,\u201D and \u201CFair Trade.\u201D\nAs reported by Forbes, the food industry is increasingly adopting the use of blockchain to track the path and safety of food throughout the farm-to-user journey.\nAs mentioned above, blockchain could facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia.\nUsing blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and providing officials with nearly instant results. This would eliminate the need for recounts or any real concern that fraud might threaten the election.\nPros and Cons of Blockchain\nFor all of its complexity, blockchain\u2019s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.\nImproved accuracy by removing human involvement in verification\nCost reductions by eliminating third-party verification\nDecentralization makes it harder to tamper with\nTransactions are secure, private, and efficient\nTransparent technology\nProvides a banking alternative and a way to secure personal information for citizens of countries with unstable or underdeveloped governments\nSignificant technology cost associated with some blockchains\nLow transactions per second\nHistory of use in illicit activities, such as on the dark web\nRegulation varies by jurisdiction and remains uncertain\nData storage limitations\nBenefits of Blockchains\nTransactions on the blockchain network are approved by thousands of computers and devices. This removes almost all people from the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain and not be accepted by the rest of the network.\nTypically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction or a notary to sign a document. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification\u2014and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee when they accept credit card payments because banks and payment-processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.\nBlockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change.\nBy spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with.\nTransactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week\u2014but a blockchain works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year.\nOn some blockchains, transactions can be completed in minutes and considered secure after just a few. This is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.\nMany blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network\u2019s transaction history. Although users can access transaction details, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like Bitcoin are fully anonymous; they are actually pseudonymous because there is a viewable address that can be associated with a user if the information gets out.\nOnce a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. After the transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its unique hash and the unique hash of the block before it. Therefore, the blocks cannot be altered once the network confirms them.\nMost blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. However, it also means there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin\u2019s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.\nPerhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and cryptocurrency is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, location, or cultural background to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.3 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth. Moreover, nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.\nThese people are often paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places, incentivizing robbers or violence. While not impossible to steal, crypto makes it more difficult for would-be thieves.\nBlockchains of the future are also looking for solutions to not only be a unit of account for wealth storage but also to store medical records, property rights, and a variety of other legal contracts.\nDrawbacks of Blockchains\nAlthough blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. For example, the Bitcoin network's proof-of-work system to validate transactions consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the energy consumed by the millions of devices on the Bitcoin network is more than Pakistan consumes annually.\nSome solutions to these issues are beginning to arise. For example, bitcoin-mining farms have been set up to use solar power, excess natural gas from fracking sites, or energy from wind farms.\nBitcoin is a perfect case study for the possible inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin\u2019s PoW system takes about 10 minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it\u2019s estimated that the blockchain network can only manage about three transactions per second (TPS). Although other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, perform better than Bitcoin, blockchain still limits them. Legacy brand Visa, for context, can process 65,000 TPS.\nSolutions to this issue have been in development for years. There are currently blockchains that boast more than 30,000 TPS. Ethereum's merge between its main net and beacon chain (Sep. 15, 2022) is predicted to allow up to 100,000 TPS after it rolls out a series of upgrades that include sharding\u2014a splitting of the database so that more devices (phones, tablets, and laptops) can run Ethereum. This is expected to increase network participation, reduce congestion, and increase transaction speeds.\nThe other issue is that each block can only hold so much data. The block size debate has been and continues to be one of the most pressing issues for the scalability of blockchains going forward.\nWhile confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network. The most cited example of blockchain being used for illicit transactions is probably the Silk Road, an online dark web illegal-drug and money laundering marketplace operating from February 2011 until October 2013, when the FBI shut it down.\nThe dark web allows users to buy and sell illegal goods without being tracked by using the Tor Browser and make illicit purchases in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This is in stark contrast to U.S. regulations, which require financial service providers to obtain information about their customers when they open an account. They are supposed to verify the identity of each customer and confirm that they do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations.\nIllicit activity accounted for only 0.24% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2022.\nThis system can be seen as both a pro and a con. It gives anyone access to financial accounts, but allows criminals to transact more easily. Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking the unbanked world, outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished through untraceable cash.\nMany in the crypto space have expressed concerns about government regulation over cryptocurrencies. While it is getting increasingly difficult and near impossible to end something like Bitcoin as its decentralized network grows, governments could theoretically make it illegal to own cryptocurrencies or participate in their networks.\nThis concern has grown smaller over time as large companies like PayPal begin to allow customers to use cryptocurrencies on their e-commerce platforms.\nWhat Is a Blockchain in Simple Terms?\nSimply put, a blockchain is a shared database or ledger. Pieces of data are stored in data structures known as blocks, and each network node has a replica of the entire database. Security is ensured since the majority will not accept this change if somebody tries to edit or delete an entry in one copy of the ledger.\nHow Many Blockchains Are There?\nThe number of live blockchains is growing every day at an ever-increasing pace. As of 2023, there are more than 23,000 active cryptocurrencies based on blockchain, with several hundred more non-cryptocurrency blockchains.\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between a Private Blockchain and a Public Blockchain?\nA public blockchain, also known as an open or permissionless blockchain, is one where anybody can join the network freely and establish a node. Because of their open nature, these blockchains must be secured with cryptography and a consensus system like proof of work (PoW). A private or permissioned blockchain, on the other hand, requires each node to be approved before joining. Because nodes are considered to be trusted, the layers of security do not need to be as robust.\nThe Bottom Line\nWith many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself in no small part because of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer middlemen.\nAs we head into the third decade of blockchain, it\u2019s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to the technology\u2014it\u2019s a question of when. Today, we see a proliferation of NFTs and the tokenization of assets. As a result, the next decades will prove to be a significant period of growth for blockchain.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens are unique digital assets that use Blockchain technology to verify their ownership and authenticity, and they are revolutionizing the way artists can sell and distribute their work.\nIn this article, we will explore the intersection of art and technology by examining the concept of NFTs and Blockchain technology. We will delve into how they work, their benefits, and the challenges and limitations they present. Finally, we will examine the impact of NFTs and Blockchain on the art industry and make predictions for their future.\nUnderstanding NFTs:\nNFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a particular item, such as a piece of art, music, or video. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, NFTs are non-fungible, which means they cannot be exchanged for another asset of equal value, as they represent something unique and specific.\n\nNFTs use Blockchain technology to verify ownership and authenticity, which ensures that the item cannot be replicated or copied without the owner\u2019s consent. Blockchain technology works by creating a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions and ownership of assets. This ledger is distributed across a network of computers, making it extremely difficult to hack or corrupt.\nFor artists, NFTs offer a new and exciting way to sell and distribute their work. By creating an NFT, an artist can verify ownership of their work, which helps to combat piracy and protect their intellectual property. Additionally, NFTs allow artists to sell their work directly to collectors, without the need for intermediaries, such as galleries or auction houses.\nNFTs also offer benefits for collectors, as they allow for the ownership and provenance of a piece of art to be easily traced and verified. This transparency increases trust between buyers and sellers, which can lead to increased sales and higher prices for artists.\nUnderstanding Blockchain Technology:\nBlockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. It is a shared database that stores a network of records or blocks in chronological order. Each block contains a set of transactions that are validated by a network of participants, known as nodes. These nodes work together to validate and verify transactions, ensuring that the ledger remains secure and tamper-proof.\n\nOne of the key features of blockchain technology is that it is decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority or intermediary controlling the network. Instead, it operates on a peer-to-peer basis, with all participants having equal rights and responsibilities. This makes the system more resistant to censorship, corruption, and manipulation.\nAnother important feature of blockchain technology is that it is immutable, meaning that once a transaction is recorded in the ledger, it cannot be altered or deleted. This makes it an ideal platform for recording and storing sensitive information, such as financial transactions or medical records.\nIn order to add new blocks to the blockchain, a consensus mechanism must be used to ensure that all nodes agree on the state of the ledger. There are several different consensus mechanisms that can be used, including Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). Each mechanism has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of mechanism will depend on the specific needs and goals of the network.\nOne of the most well-known use cases for blockchain technology is cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These digital assets operate on their own blockchain networks and are used as a means of exchange or store of value. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity due to their decentralized nature, which allows for greater privacy, security, and freedom than traditional financial systems.\nBeyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications, including supply chain management, voting systems, and identity verification. These applications can benefit from the transparency, security, and immutability of blockchain technology, which can help to reduce fraud, increase efficiency, and improve accountability.\nHowever, there are also challenges associated with blockchain technology, including scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory issues. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be important to address these challenges in order to unlock its full potential.\nThe Intersection of Art and Technology:\nThe intersection of art and technology has been a topic of interest for many years, as new technologies continue to change the way we create, distribute, and consume art. NFTs are the latest innovation that brings these two fields together, creating new opportunities and challenges for artists and collectors.\n\nNFTs have opened up a new market for digital art, which was previously difficult to monetize and protect. Digital art is easy to reproduce and share, making it vulnerable to piracy and intellectual property theft. NFTs provide a solution to these problems by creating a unique, verifiable ownership record that cannot be replicated or copied.\nNFTs have also provided a new way for artists to sell their work directly to collectors, without the need for intermediaries such as galleries or auction houses. This has created a more accessible and democratic art market, where emerging artists can gain exposure and recognition without relying on traditional gatekeepers.\nHowever, the rise of NFTs has also raised concerns about the environmental impact of Blockchain technology. The energy consumption required to validate and record transactions on the Blockchain is significant, leading to concerns about the carbon footprint of NFTs and their impact on the environment.\nDespite these challenges, the intersection of art and technology has opened up exciting new possibilities for artists, collectors, and the art market as a whole. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see further innovations and developments in this field, creating new opportunities for creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship.\nChallenges and Limitations of NFTs and Blockchain Technology in the Art Industry:\nOne of the biggest challenges facing NFTs and blockchain technology in the art industry is the issue of authenticity. While NFTs can provide a secure and transparent means of verifying ownership, they do not guarantee the authenticity of the artwork itself. It is still possible for artists to create forgeries or copies of their own work, or for hackers to create fraudulent NFTs. As such, it is important for buyers to do their own research and due diligence before purchasing an NFT, and for artists to take steps to ensure the authenticity of their work.\n\nAnother limitation of NFTs and blockchain technology in the art industry is the issue of accessibility. While blockchain technology can provide a means of democratizing access to the art market, by allowing artists to sell their work directly to buyers without the need for intermediaries, it can also be a barrier for some artists and buyers who may not have the technical knowledge or resources to participate. Additionally, the high fees associated with NFT transactions and the energy consumption of blockchain networks can make it difficult for smaller artists and buyers to participate.\nFurthermore, there is a challenge of environmental sustainability associated with NFTs and blockchain technology. The energy consumption required to maintain blockchain networks and the processing power needed to mine and validate transactions can be significant, and this can have a negative impact on the environment. As such, there is a need to develop more sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives for blockchain technology in the art industry.\nFinally, there are also regulatory and legal challenges associated with NFTs and blockchain technology in the art industry. As the technology is still relatively new, there is a lack of clear guidance and regulations regarding the sale and ownership of NFTs, and this can create uncertainty and risk for buyers and artists. Additionally, there are issues related to copyright and intellectual property rights, which can be difficult to enforce in a decentralized and anonymous environment.\nFuture of NFTs and Blockchain in the Art Industry:\nThe future of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain technology in the art industry is exciting and holds great promise. Despite the challenges and limitations discussed in the previous section, there are several opportunities for NFTs and blockchain technology to transform the way we think about art ownership, access, and valuation.\n\nOne of the key benefits of NFTs and blockchain technology in the art industry is the potential to create new revenue streams for artists. By selling digital artworks as NFTs, artists can retain ownership of their work and earn a share of the value created through subsequent sales. This can help to reduce the dependence on traditional art market intermediaries and enable artists to reach a global audience of collectors and fans.\nAnother potential benefit of NFTs and blockchain technology in the art industry is the ability to create more transparent and traceable art markets. By using blockchain technology to store information about art ownership and provenance, buyers can have greater confidence in the authenticity and value of the art they are purchasing. This can also help to reduce fraud and the circulation of fake artwork in the market.\nFurthermore, NFTs and blockchain technology can also provide a means of democratizing access to the art market. By removing barriers to entry, such as high transaction fees and the need for intermediaries, more artists and buyers can participate in the market. This can help to create a more diverse and inclusive art ecosystem, where artists from underrepresented communities can gain greater exposure and recognition.\nIn addition, the use of blockchain technology in the art industry can also provide new opportunities for engaging with audiences and building communities around art. By creating digital platforms for buying, selling, and displaying art, artists, and buyers can connect in new and innovative ways, and build networks of like-minded individuals who share a passion for art.\nLooking ahead, the future of NFTs and blockchain technology in the art industry will depend on continued innovation and development.

This distributed ledger system eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces the risk of fraud, and ensures transparency and traceability.\nChallenges in Traditional Logistics and Supply Chain Management\nLack of Transparency: Limited visibility across the supply chain leads to delays in identifying issues and resolving them efficiently.\nComplexity and Inefficiency: Supply chains involve multiple stakeholders, processes, and systems, leading to complexity and inefficiencies in operations.\nCounterfeit and Fraudulent Activities: The opaque nature of traditional supply chains makes them vulnerable to counterfeit products, theft, and fraudulent activities.\nData Silos and Interoperability Issues: Data is often stored in centralised databases, resulting in siloed information and interoperability challenges between different systems and stakeholders.\nBlockchain Solutions for Logistics and Supply Chain Management\nTransparency and Traceability: Blockchain enables end-to-end visibility and traceability of products throughout the supply chain. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, allowing stakeholders to track the movement and origin of goods in real time.\nEnhanced Security: The decentralised nature of blockchain ensures data integrity and security, reducing the risk of tampering, fraud, and unauthorised access.\nSmart Contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined terms and conditions encoded on the blockchain. They automate and enforce agreements between parties, streamlining processes such as payments, deliveries, and compliance.\nSupply Chain Automation: Blockchain facilitates automation of supply chain processes through smart contracts and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Automated workflows enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and enable real-time monitoring of assets.\nImproved Compliance and Risk Management: Blockchain enables the transparent recording of regulatory compliance and certification data. This ensures adherence to industry standards and mitigates risks associated with non-compliance.\nBlockchain in Logistics and Supply Chain Management\nTrack and Trace: Blockchain enables tracking and tracing of products from the point of origin to the final destination, enhancing visibility and accountability in the supply chain.\nProvenance and Authentication: Blockchain verifies the authenticity and provenance of products, reducing the risk of counterfeit goods and ensuring quality and safety standards.\nCold Chain Management: In industries such as pharmaceuticals and food, blockchain ensures the integrity of temperature-sensitive products during transportation and storage by recording temperature data on the blockchain.\nCross-Border Trade: Blockchain simplifies and accelerates cross-border trade by digitising and automating customs processes, reducing paperwork, delays, and administrative costs.\nRecommended by LinkedIn\nTransparency and Traceability\nOne of the primary benefits of blockchain technology in supply chain management is enhanced transparency and traceability. By recording every transaction in a tamper-proof manner, blockchain enables stakeholders to track the movement of goods from the point of origin to the final destination. This visibility into the supply chain helps identify inefficiencies, reduce errors, and mitigate risks such as counterfeiting and product recalls.\nStreamlining Supply Chain Operations\nBlockchain technology streamlines supply chain operations by automating processes, reducing paperwork, and minimising administrative overhead. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predefined rules encoded into the blockchain, facilitate automatic payments, enforce agreements, and streamline complex supply chain transactions. This automation improves efficiency, reduces costs, and accelerates the speed of transactions across the supply chain.\nEnsuring Data Security and Integrity\nData security is paramount in supply chain management, where sensitive information such as product specifications, pricing, and customer data is exchanged among multiple parties. Blockchain's cryptographic algorithms and decentralised architecture ensure data security and integrity by encrypting information and distributing it across the network. This protects against unauthorised access, tampering, and data breaches, enhancing trust and reliability among supply chain participants.\nSupply Chain Visibility and Real-time Monitoring\nBlockchain technology provides real-time visibility into supply chain processes, enabling stakeholders to monitor inventory levels, track shipments, and identify bottlenecks in real time. By leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as RFID tags and sensors, blockchain-enabled supply chains can capture and transmit data seamlessly, facilitating proactive decision-making and improving responsiveness to market demands.\nFuture Outlook and Challenges\nWhile blockchain technology holds immense promise for transforming logistics and supply chain management.\nScalability: Blockchain networks must scale to accommodate the large volume of transactions and data associated with global supply chains.\nInteroperability: Standardisation and interoperability between different blockchain platforms and systems are essential for seamless integration across supply chain networks.\nRegulatory and Legal Frameworks: Regulatory clarity and legal frameworks governing blockchain adoption and data privacy are necessary to ensure compliance and trust among stakeholders.\nCost and Implementation Complexity: The initial cost and complexity of implementing blockchain solutions may pose challenges for smaller organisations and businesses.\nTGL\nWe specialise in offering business-to-business logistics services, including sea freight, air freight, domestic freight, warehousing, and customs clearance to all industries.

According to the Council on Foreign Relations, overall turnout in 2020 U.S. national elections lied at 62 percent, falling three percent below the 65 percent average for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2014 meaning that we still have a ways to go to improve our voting participation.\nWhy are Americans not turning up at the polls? Candidate dissatisfaction, electoral process frustration and voter place inaccessibility all play a role.\nOnly one in five Americans are very confident in the country\u2019s election system, as recorded in a poll by ABC News and The Washington Post. Additionally, in a research report on global assessments of the quality of national elections, the Election Integrity Project noted the U.S. as the lowest ranked among liberal democracies. Plus, physically getting to the polls on Election Day is a roadblock for many potential voters.\nIf we want to improve our election process, it\u2019s worth considering how we can use blockchain.\nWhile blockchain voting won\u2019t solve all our problems \u2014 and even introduces a few of its own \u2014 the promise of the technology to revolutionize the American elections system is intriguing.\n\n\nHow Blockchain Voting Works\nAccording to Washington, D.C. think tank Brookings Institution, blockchain voting, or decentralized voting, has the potential to solve a number of problems like combating voter fraud and ensuring every vote is counted. This would be thanks in part to the nature of blockchain technology and how it stores and transmits information.\nPotential Benefits of Blockchain Voting\nBlockchain works to be inherently secure and ensure original information is unchangeable, providing a single-source-of-truth and acting as a tracking method for any data recorded. When applied to voting, this could mean the opportunity for unaltered votes, voting transparency, increased online accessibility and more organized voting operations.\nHere are a few examples of how blockchain voting technology is playing out in both the private and public sectors.\n\nBlockchain Voting Applications to Know\nLocation: Boston, Massachusetts\nVoatz is a mobile election platform that runs entirely on blockchain. The company\u2019s voting platform uses a three-step voter authentication process, including fingerprint recognition, a live photo and a one-phone, one-vote system.\nOnce a voter has been confirmed eligible by cross-referencing a driver\u2019s license, the voter mark their ballot by distributing tokens to each candidate. The tokens are debited from the voters public ledger and added to the candidates ledger. The candidate with the most tokens wins the election.\nVoatz\u2019s technology has already been used by some absentee and overseas military personnel voters to cast their votes in West Virginia in 2018 and Colorado in 2019.\n\nLocation: Golden, Colorado\nFollow My Vote is an online voting platform using open-source blockchain ballot boxes.\nWith a webcam and valid voting ID, election participants can remotely cast a vote from any mobile device. The company\u2019s software produces a unique ID for each voter that cannot be replicated.\nBecause elections can have last-second developments, Follow My Vote gives voters the ability to go back and change their choice up until the last second of the voting deadline.\nThe company\u2019s reliability on blockchain also allows for participants to see election results in real-time for a more transparent and faster election process.\n\nLocation: Cleveland, Ohio\nVotem is a combined suite of election management solution software built on the company\u2019s blockchain-based CastIron Platform. Votem\u2019s software offers various avenues on desktop and mobile for increasing voter accessibility and saving time in the voting process. Depending on the feature, users are able to register to vote, pre-mark ballots, vote remotely or create complete voting systems all online.\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Votem was used to facilitate voter registration as well as absentee ballot requests and delivery in Montana and Washington, D.C.\n","Ngày tạo":"Sep 21, 2022","Nguồn website":"builtin.com"}]
